<h3>Imaage Optimization</h3>
<p>After reading the two articles it just strengthens what I previously learned in my web development class and that is that image optimization is one of if not the most important things when it comes to websites. Images are extremely appealing to viewers because it captivates them. In the first article it says websites images count for 21% of webpages weight. So image optimization is extremely important for websites so they can have more images. The three most important and major things Iâ€™ve taken away from reading is first that smaller image files will take less bandwidth which in turn will lead to faster load times for the site. Second is that faster load times will lead to more people using the site because people prefer sites that can load fast. Finally the load times and traffic will intern cause better SEO and high ranking on the search algorithm. Which is kind of the overall main point of a website.
